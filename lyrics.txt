How dare you say that my behaviour's unacceptable
So condescending unnecessarily critical
I have the tendency of getting very physical
So watch your step 'cause if I do you'll need a miracle

You drain me dry and make me wonder why I'm even here
The double vision I was seeing is finally clear
You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
Not fit to fuckin' tread the ground that I am walking on

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up."
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
You should know better you never listened to a word I said
Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up."
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
She said
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

And does it kill?
Does it burn?
Is it painful to learn
That it's me that has all the control?

Does it thrill?
Does it sting
When you feel what I bring
And you wish that you had me to hold?

When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
You'll understand what I mean when I say
"There's no way we're gonna give up."
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And like a little girl cries in the face of a monster that lives in her dreams
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?
Is there anyone out there 'cause it's getting harder and harder to breathe?

I was so high I did not recognize
The fire burning in her eyes
The chaos that controlled my mind
Whispered "Goodbye" as she got on a plane
Never to return again
But always in my heart, oh

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I tried my best to feed her appetite
Keep her coming every night
So hard to keep her satisfied, oh
Kept playing love like it was just a game
Pretending to feel the same
Then turn around and leave again
But I know

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh
Whoa, oh, oh, oh

I'll fix these broken things
Repair your broken wings
And make sure everything's alright
(It's alright, it's alright)
My pressure on your hips
Sinking my fingertips
Into every inch of you
'Cause I know that's what you want me to do

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
Her heart is breaking in front of me
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

This love has taken its toll on me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
And my heart is breaking in front of me
She said "Goodbye" too many times before

This love has taken its toll on me
(Oh, yeah, yeah)
She said "Goodbye" too many times before
(Yeah)
And her heart is breaking in front of me
(Yeah)
And I have no choice 'cause I won't say "Goodbye" anymore

This love has taken its toll on me 

You build me up, you knock me down
Provoke a smile and make me frown
You are the queen of runaround
You know it's true
You chew me up and spit me out
Enjoy the taste I leave in your mouth
You look at me, I look at you
Neither of us know what to do

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin

Immobilized by the thought of you
I'm paralyzed by the sight of you
I'm hypnotized by the words you say
Not true, but I believe 'em anyway
So come to bed, it's getting late
There's no more time for us to waste
Remember how my body tastes
You feel your heart begin to race

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in (Hey)
And I shiver when I hear your name
Think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah)

Yeah, oh
(You feel your heart begin to race!)

There may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin

Yeah, yeah, there may not be another way to your heart
So I guess I'd better find a new way in
And I shiver when I hear your name
I think about you, but it's not the same
I won't be satisfied 'til I'm under your skin (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Beauty queen of only eighteen
She had some trouble with herself
He was always there to help her
She always belonged to someone else

I drove for miles and miles and wound up at your door
I've had you so many times but somehow I want more

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful
I know I tend to get so insecure
Doesn't matter anymore

It's not always rainbows and butterflies
It's compromise that moves us along, yeah
My heart is full and my door's always open
You come any time you want, yeah

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved

I know where you hide alone in your car
Know all of the things that make you who you are
I know that goodbye means nothing at all
Comes back and makes me catch her every time she falls
Yeah

Tap on my window, knock on my door
I want to make you feel beautiful

I don't mind spending every day
Out on your corner in the pouring rain
Look for the girl with the broken smile
Ask her if she wants to stay a while
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
And she will be loved
(Please don't try so hard to say goodbye)
And she will be loved

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh)
Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

(I don't mind spending every day, ooh)
Out on your corner in the pouring rain

Please don't try so hard to say goodbye

Mm

I'm full of regret
For all things that I have done and said
And I don't know
If it'll ever be okay to show
My face around here (Face around here)
Sometimes I wonder if I disappear

Would you ever turn your head and look?
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know, I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh

You're just innocent
A helpless victim of a spider's web
And I'm an insect
Goin' after anything that I can get

So you better turn your head and run
And don't look back
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up

Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

You better turn your head and run
See if I'm gone
'Cause I fear

There is nothing left to say to you
That you wanna hear, that you wanna know
I think I should go
The things I've done are way too shameful, oh
(Shameful, shameful)
And I've done you so wrong
Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself
I don't know how I got so tangled up
Yeah, tangled
(And I've done you so wrong)
(Treated you bad, strung you along, oh, shame on myself)
(I don't know how I got so tangled up)

After school walking home
Fresh dirt under my fingernails
And I can smell hot asphalt
Cars screech to a halt to let me pass

And I cannot remember
What life was like through photographs
And trying to recreate images life gives us from our past

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun."

Moving on down my street
I see people I won't ever meet
Think of her, take a breath
Feel the beat in the rhythm of my steps

And sometimes it's a sad song

But I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun."

The rhythm of her conversation
The perfection of her creation
The sex she slipped into my coffee
The way she felt when she first saw me

Hate to love and love to hate her
Like a broken record player
Back and forth and here and gone
And on and on and on and on

I cannot forget
Refuse to regret
So glad I met
You and take my breath away
Make everyday
Worth all of the pain
That I have gone through

And, mama, I've been cryin'
'Cause things ain't how they used to be
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles—."
She said, "The battle's almost won,
And we're only several miles from the sun."

I've been the needle and the thread
Weaving figure eights and circles 'round your head
I try to laugh but cry instead
Patiently wait to hear the words you've never said

Fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
Oh yeah

"This is not goodbye," she said
It is just time for me to rest my head
She does not walk, she runs instead
Down these jagged streets and into my bed

When I was fumbling through your dresser drawer
Forgot what I was looking for
Try to guide me in the right direction
Making use of all this time
Keeping everything inside
Close my eyes and listen to you crying

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

There's only so much I can do for you, oh
After all of the things you put me through, oh

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

I'm lifting you up
I'm letting you down
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around
I'm not giving up
I'm making your love
This city's made us crazy and we must get out

(Whoa) I'm lifting you up (Oh)
I'm letting you down (Whoa)
I'm dancing 'til dawn
I'm fooling around (Whoa)
I'm not giving up (Whoa)
I'm making your love (Yeah)
This city's made us crazy and we must get out
 
Yeah

Sunday morning, rain is falling
Steal some covers, share some skin (Like that)
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
You twist to fit the mold that I am in

But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life is hard)
And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew
That someday, it would lead me back to you
That someday, it would lead me back to you (Someday)

That may be all I'll need
In darkness, she is all I see (All I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave

(Yeah) Fingers trace your every outline (Oh yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Paint a picture with my hands (Oh, oh, whoa)
And back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm
Change the weather, still together when it ends

That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
And I never want to leave
Oh yeah
But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do (Life gets hard)
Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you
Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you, yeah
(Someday, oh, someday, oh)
Find a way to bring myself back home to you

You may not know
That may be all I need (All I need)
In darkness, she is all I see (You are all I see)
Come and rest your bones with me
Driving slow on Sunday morning
Driving slow, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah
Ah, yeah, yeah

There's a flower in your hair
I'm a flower in your hair
Oh yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh
Whoa, oh, yeah
Woo
(All I need)
Yeah, yeah
(All I see)
Yeah
(Bones with me)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
(All I need)
(All I see)

Watch the sunrise
Say your goodbyes, off you go
Some conversation
No contemplation, hit the road

Car overheats, jump out of my seat
On the side of the highway, baby
Our road is long, your hold is strong
Please don't ever let go, oh, no

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no, they can't

I'm driving fast now
Don't think I know how to go slow
Oh, where you at now?
I feel around, there you are

Cool these engines, calm these jets
I ask you, "How hot can it get?"
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
Slowly, you say, "I'm not there yet"

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh, no, they can't

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I know I don't know you
But I want you so bad
Everyone has a secret
Oh, can they keep it?
Oh no, they can't

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah

Through With You

Can you see me floating above your head
As you lay in bed thinking about everything
That you did not do? 'Cause saying "I love you"
Has nothing to do with meaning it
Oh, oh, oh
And I don't trust you 'cause every time you're here
Your intentions are unclear, I spend every hour waiting
For a phone call that I know will never come
I used to think you were the one, now I'm sick of thinking anything at all

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that

Do you remember the way we used to melt?
Do you remember how it felt when I touched you?
Oh, 'cause I remember very well

And how long has it been, since someone you let in
Has given what I gave to you?
And at night when you sleep, do you dream I would be there
Just for a minute or two, do you?

You ain't ever coming back to me
That's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through with you, oh

You ain't ever coming back to me
And that's not how things were supposed to be
You take my hand just to give it back
No other lover has ever done that
Heartache, heartache, I just have so much
A simple love with a complex touch
And there is nothing you can say or do
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through
I called to let you know I'm through with you

I ain't ever coming back to you

When you refuse me, you confuse me
What makes you think I'll let you in again?
Think again, my friend
Go on, misuse me and abuse me
I'll come out stronger in the end

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

You do not know how much this hurts me
To say these things that I don't wanna say
But have to say them anyway
Oh, I would do anything to end your suffering
But you would rather walk away

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone?
Does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home

Oh, yeah

Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? (Find yourself alone)
And does it make you mad
To find that I have grown?
Does it make you sad
To find yourself alone? Yeah
Does it make you mad
To see how I have grown?
Bet it hurts so bad
To see the strength that I have shown

When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, yeah)
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, oh)
When you answer the door, pick up the phone
You won't find me 'cause I'm not coming home (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Thank you!
Goodnight!
Woo!

Oh, uh-huh
Yeah, yeah, oh

Where you are seems to be
As far as an eternity
Outstretched arms, open hearts
And if it never ends, then when do we start?

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
I know you understand
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I

Dream away every day
Try so hard to disregard
The rhythm of the rain that drops
And coincides with the beating of my heart

I'll never leave you behind
Or treat you unkind
And I know you'll understand, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a tear in my eye
Give me the sweetest goodbye
That I ever, ever, ever did receive

Pushing forward and arching back
Bring me closer to heart attack
Say goodbye and just fly away
When you come back
I have something to say, yeah
How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel

Ooh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
Pushing forward and arching back (Yeah, oh)
Bring me closer to heart attack (Oh-oh-oh, yeah)

How does it feel to know you'll never have to be alone
When you get home? (Home)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel, feel, feel
(Show you how I feel, show you how I feel, show you, show you how I feel)
There must be someplace here that only you and I could go
So I can show you how I feel, feel (Show me, show me, show me)

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes me burn to learn you're with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am

Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you (Find you, find you)
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you (Right behind you)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind (Promise not to leave me behind)
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time (Talk to me, talk to me)

'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
And if I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
(Torture me, yeah, torture me)

Keep me coming back for more (Coming back for more)
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight

Wake up, blood-shot eye
Struggle to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry

It feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath
After that, after that
Try to get you back

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah
So, this is goodbye

God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I've left unsaid

I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind, make your move
Forget about the truth

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no
So, this is goodbye
Oh-oh-oh-oh

I've been here before
One day I'll wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
'Cause

I still don't have a reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so, this is goodbye

Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try, yeah
Yeah

And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true anymore, anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
Oh no
So, this is goodbye
Oh no
So, this is goodbye
Oh no
Yeah
So, this is goodbye
Oh no
Yeah
So, this is goodbye

I'm sick of picking the pieces
And second-guessing
My reasons why you don't trust me
Why must we do this to one another?
We are just passionate lovers
With trouble under the covers
Nothing worse than when
You know that it's over

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Well, I've got nothing to hide
Dip down and come for a ride
Embrace a devil so sly
You cannot hear 'em coming
'Cause my defenses are weak
I have no breath left to speak
So take the evidence
And bury it somewhere

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

Oh my, I don't mind
Being the other guy
Nice try, for these games
I do not have the time
If you want me, call me
Come and take a risk
Kiss me somewhere deep below the surface

I just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To say the words I never said
Just need a little of your time
A little of your time
To show you that I am not dead

Please don't leave, stay in bed
Touch my body instead
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?
Gonna make you feel it
Can you still feel it?

I didn't hear what you were saying
I live on raw emotion, baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to say we
Never would have made it, babe?

If you needed love
Well, then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What is coming now
So don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't think so

Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I find you sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
Hear a sound and hit the ground

If you needed love
Well, then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad, I don't feel so bad

I'm so sorry, darling
Did I do the wrong thing?
Oh, what was I thinking?
Is his heart still beating?

Whoa, oh, oh

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
And he won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me? I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
And he won't come around here anymore
No, he won't come around here
I don't feel so bad

I don't feel so bad (Wake up call)
I don't feel so bad (Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed)
I don't feel so bad (Don't you care about me anymore?)
(Don't you care about me?)
I don't feel so bad

Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?

I asked her to stay
But she wouldn't listen
And she left before I had the chance to say, oh
The words that would mend
The things that were broken
But now it's far too late, she's gone away

Every night, you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

The taste of her breath
I'll never get over
The noises that she made kept me awake, oh
The weight of the things
That remained unspoken
Built up so much, it crushed us every day

Every night, you cry yourself to sleep
Thinking, "Why does this happen to me?
Why does every moment have to be so hard?"
Hard to believe that

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh-whoa-oh-oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh-whoa-oh-oh

Of all the things I felt but never really showed
Perhaps the worst is that I ever let you go
I should not ever let you go, oh-oh-oh

It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you
Oh-whoa-oh-oh
It's not over tonight
Just give me one more chance to make it right
I may not make it through the night
I won't go home without you

And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you
And I won't go home without you

It is so easy to see
Dysfunction between you and me
We must free up these tired souls
Before the sadness kills us both
I tried and tried to let you know
I love you, but I'm letting go
It may not last, but I don't know
Just don't know

If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you

Every day
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

A bed that's warm with memories
Can heal us temporarily
But misbehaving only makes
The ditch between us so damn deep
Built a wall around my heart
Never let it fall apart
Strangely, I wish secretly
It would fall down while I'm asleep

If you don't know, then you can't care
And I show up, but you're not there
But I'm waiting and you want to
Still afraid that I will desert you, baby

Every day
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

But we have not hit the ground
Doesn't mean we're not still falling, oh
I want so bad to pick you up
But you're still too reluctant to accept my help
What a shame
I hope you find somewhere to place the blame
But until then, the fact remains

Every day
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
Nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe (Yeah)
It hurts, but it may be the only way
Every day
With every worthless word
We get more far away
The distance between us makes it so hard to stay
But nothing lasts forever
But be honest, babe
It hurts, but it may be the only way

One, two, three

All alone in my room, think of you at a rate that is truly alarming
I keep looping my memories of you in my head, I pretend that you want me
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about your love

Oh, yeah

Can't believe I could think that she would just follow me everywhere I go
I just wrestle with you in my dreams and wake up making love to a pillow
And I fall asleep and dream of alternate realities
And I put myself at ease by pretending that she still loves me

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You never call, what do I do?
And I can't stop, and I can't stop

What I would give to have you look in my direction
And I'd give my life to somehow attract your attention
And I touch myself like it's somebody else
Thoughts of you are tattooed on my mind
Let me show you

And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
And I can't stop thinking about you
You'll never go, what do I do?
And I can't stop thinking about you

Goodnight Goodnight

You left me hanging from the thread
We once swung from together
I lick my wounds
But I can never see them getting better
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
Her hair was pressed against her face
Her eyes were red with anger
Enraged by things unsaid
And empty beds and bad behavior

Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Whoa, whoa, oh

The room was silent as we all tried so hard to remember
The way it feels to be alive
The day that he first met her
Something's gotta change
Things cannot stay the same
You make me think of someone wonderful
But I can't place her
I wake up every morning
Wishing one more time to face her

Something's gotta change
It must be rearranged
Oh

I'm sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
I cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright

So much to love, so much to learn
But I won't be there to teach you, oh
I know I can't be close
But I'll try my best to reach you

I'm so sorry
I did not mean to hurt my little girl
It's beyond me
Cannot carry the weight of the heavy world
So goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight
Goodnight, hope that things work out alright, yeah
Whoa, whoa, oh, yeah

Ooh

Danced all night, slept all day
Careless with my heart again
Fearless when it comes to playing games

You don't cry, you don't care
Afraid to have a love affair
Is that your ghost or are you really there?

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

Ooh, oh

Weather on a sunny day
Time slows down; I wish you'd stay
Pass me by in crowded, dark hallways, mm
Try my hardest not to scream
I find my heart is growing weak
So leave your reasons on the bathroom sink

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Take what you wanted
I will be just fine
You will be better off alone at night
Waiting and falling
Constantly calling out your name
Will it ever change?

Now I can't walk, I can't talk anymore
Since you walked out the door
And now I'm stuck living out that night again
I'm not falling apart

I heard you say you needed me now
What's the problem? I can't see
You destroyed me, I won't fall apart again
I'm not falling apart

Oh, ooh

You're such a flirt, I know you hurt
And so do I, I empathize
I see you out, you never cared
A conversation that we never shared

But it's so strange, it's something new
Amazing feelings that I have for you
I close my eyes when I'm alone
Wonder what it'd be like to make you moan

I wanna give you something better
Than anything you've ever had
A stronger and a faster lover
The world, it disappears so fast

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins

So give it up and don't pretend
And spread your arms and legs across the bed
And when you shake, you won't regret
The things I whisper in your ear (What?)
I said

"I wanna give you something better
(You wanna give me something better.)
Than anything you've ever had
(Than anything I've ever had.)
A stronger and a faster lover
(A stronger and a faster lover)
The world, it disappears so fast
(It disappears so fast)."

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins

I can't wait to take you home
Fingers through your hair
Kisses on your back
Scratch me with your nails

Save me from myself
Show me how to care
Get everything out
Dripping everywhere

Lipstick smeared all over your face
How much longer must we wait?
Don't think that I can wait

Sweet kiwi
Your juices dripping down my chin
So please, let me
Don't stop it before it begins, hey, yeah

Sweet kiwi
(Wanna give you something better than this.)
Your juices dripping down my chin, hey, yeah
So please, let me
(Wanna give you something better than this.)
Don't stop it before it begins

Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins
Don't stop it before it begins

I never knew perfection 'til
I heard you speak, and now it kills me
Just to hear you say the simple things

Now waking up is hard to do
And sleeping's impossible too
Everything's reminding me of you
What can I do?

It's not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?
It's better that we break

A fool to let you slip away
I chase you just to hear you say
You're scared and that you think that I'm insane

The city looks so nice from here
Pity I can't see it clearly
While you're standing there, it disappears
It disappears

It's not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?
It's better that we break

Saw you sitting all alone
You're fragile and you're cold
But that's all right
Life these days is getting rough
They've knocked you down and beat you up
But it's just a roller-coaster anyway, yeah

It's not right, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?

I'm not fine, not OK
Say the words that you say
Maybe we're better off this way?
I'm not fine, I'm in pain
It's harder everyday
Maybe we're better off this way?
It's better that we break, baby

From the moment the lights went off
Everything had changed
Lie awake in an empty room
In my head it all feels the same

Like the taste of the day you left
That still lingers on my breath
And the dampness of tears that left
A stain where you had wept

All alone with the negligee
That still hangs off of my bed
I keep meaning to give it away
But I just leave it there instead

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Three more days 'til I see your face
I'm afraid it's far too much
Cook a meal and fix up the place
Dial your number, hang it up

If I took you for granted
I apologize for acting tough
You're my reason for living
And there's no way I'm giving up, oh

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Now every evening is a bitter fight
And I'm eating home alone on a Friday night
I know what your friends say
"He's just wasting your love and time"
I will never let you change your mind

No need to cry about it
I cannot live without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

No need to cry about it
I may just die without it
Every time I wind up back at your door

Why do you do this to me?
You penetrate right through me
Every time I wind up back at your door

Every time I wind up back at your door
Every time I wind up back at your door

Miss You, Love You

This has not been easy
This has been hard
I am scarred
And I do not know what to do with you
Going south, kiss your mouth, lick my lips
Grab your hips, can't remember why I fell in love with this

But I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
Oh no, I don't need you

Who do you think you are?
No one cares about a name without a face
So don't go shooting up the place (Oh, mm)
Make no mistake, your love's not real
'Cause the love that I got is deeper so much deeper than you could ever feel

And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me to kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again, oh no
'Cause I don't need you tonight

It was really nice to know you
I got nothing left to show you
Got bills to pay, get out my way, it's time to move on
And dinner with your boyfriend will never be the same again
Discuss me over cigarettes and say to him

I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'Cause oh no, 'cause I don't need you

And I miss you, I love you
It's a shame you can't stay away from me this time, oh no
You beg me, you ask me
To kiss you and hug you
You won't be getting my affection again
'Cause oh no, I don't need you

It's so hard to find you
I'm standing right behind you
The streets are much colder
This mean I'm getting older

Why would you? How could I?
These questions lead to goodbye
But now I got my freedom
Don't I?

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

Shy girl, so humble
With eyes that make me stumble
Somehow not speaking lets me know everything
I go out, you eat in
Hot from the situation
You're naked in daylight
Wrap yourself up and goodnight

I'm burning, I'm hungry
Angry 'cause she don't love me
You got me completely
In my own game you beat me

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

I will be back again
No this is not the end
I've fallen hard this time but I'm not giving in
I want the world to know
That I won't let you forget
The tears that you shed
I'll make it impossible to let go

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

I parked my car outside your house
Hope that someday you'll come home
Seems the woman that I love
Is someone that I hardly know
And after all this time
I finally found a way to be alone
I'm terrified to think that I may be losing my mind

This relationship is over
Though my stomach still hurts
And now I'm gonna live alone
Why is the pain much worse?
You're so much better without makeup
Why would you hide your face?
Don't want to spend the night and wake up
Realize I've made a big mistake, oh

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast, I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But I am still in love with you

I never meant to keep you waiting
And now your food is getting cold
I keep denying I'm in love with you
My routine is getting old
And now you stand in front of the table
And say you never look back
Do something stupid when you're angry
You only wake up sad, oh

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you
It hurts too much to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you

No more kisses on your lips and tender touches, please
I'd rather die on my two feet than live down on my knees
And all the cuts you gave me open up and start to bleed
And I just can't get over you, until you're over me

I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)

And I cannot refuse your eyes
Please don't look at me tonight (Oh)
My heart beats fast, I know you're there
And I pretend like I don't care (Oh)
It hurts so bad to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you (Oh)
It hurts so much to know the truth
But girl, I'm still in love with you (Oh)

Baby, I don't wanna spend my life on trial
For something that I did not do
And maybe if you stopped and looked around some time
I wouldn't pass right by you
Maybe it's because you are so insecure
Maybe you plain don't care
Maybe it's the chase that really gets me off
I fall so when it's just not there

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

Try to put my finger on what burns me up
It always seems to escape me
And when you have decided that you've had enough
Just tell me where I need to be
Now I'm facing something that I never had
To ever deal with before
She left me with the feeling that she'd had enough
And I'm the one wanting more

Burn another bridge, break another heart
Try again, it will only fall apart

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

I'm so attracted to you
The feeling's mutual too
And I get scared the moment you leave
Get so hot, I forget to breathe, yeah

Infatuation
Not seeing the rest of you is getting the best of me
It's such a shame that you shot me down
It would have been nice to be around
I'm touching your skin
If it's only a fantasy, then why is it killing me?
I guess this must be infatuation
(I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)

Ooh (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Ooh (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Yeah (I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it, I want it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm happy you came to me first
Before the bubble burst
I'm happy you answered my calls
I'm bouncing off the walls
Impossible to be tamed
Her need cellophane
I'm happy you like to play games
Why did you run away?

We could spend some time together
What he had, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So let's figure it out, let's go

I'm happy you're so impulsive
Means that you're passionate
I'm happy you're moving so fast
But will it ever last?
I know you wanna break free
From this monotony
I'm happy you're coming with me
But by choice it's gotta be

We could spend some time together
What he has, he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So let's figure it out, let's go

I'm happy you're changing your speed
Slow down and lay with me
On bottom but always discrete
Kneel down and kiss her feet
I'm happy you're going too far
Full strength before we start
Sometimes you make it so hard
Scream loud as we come apart

We can spend some time together
What he had he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out, let's go

We can spend some time together
What he has he'll never know
Your boyfriend gives you no respect
And I can see you're getting it
So figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go
Figure it out, let's go

Oh yeah
Oh yeah

So scared of breaking it that you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up, I'd rather let them bleed

So let me be
And I'll set you free (Oh yeah)

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me, oh yeah

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how it mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care, it's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel, it's what I didn't show

So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back, yeah

You say your faith is shaken, and you may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused, so far away from you
I'm getting there, I don't care where I have to roam

Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah
Why do you do what you do to me? Yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me? Yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me?
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Girl, you really got me bad
You really got me bad
Now I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Now you've been bad, and it goes on and on and on
'Til you come home, babe, 'til you come home
Now you taste best, the poison I've learned to love is gone
I'm all alone, baby, I'm all alone

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh

Now, you were wrong for turning me on and on and on
And on and on
You make it so hard

I'm waiting for something, always waiting
Feeling nothing, wondering if it'll ever change (If it'll ever change)
And then I give a little more, ooh baby, oh
Give a little more, ooh baby, oh

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh

I have no defense
I know you're gonna get me in the end (Gonna get me in the end)
And I cannot pretend
I never wanna feel this way again, oh

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love (Not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh (Get a little more)
Get a little more from you, baby, ooh (Get a little more)

I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love (Not falling in love)
I'm not falling in love with ya, I'm not falling in love
'Til I get a little more from you, baby, oh (Get a little more)
Get a little more from you, baby (Get a little more)

Ooh-ooh-ooh

I really, I really (Whoa)
I really need to know
I really, I really (Whoa)
Or else, you gotta let me go, oh
I really, I really

This time I really need to do things right
Shivers that you give me keep me freezing all night
You make me shudder, oh yeah
I can't believe it, I'm not myself
Suddenly I'm thinking about no one else
You make me shudder

I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter (Ooh)

If I could touch you, I'd never let go
Now you got me screaming, and I cannot shut up
Oh, shut up, yeah
Now I am lying on the bedroom floor
Barely even speaking and I cannot get up

And I really, I really, I really need to know
Or else you gotta let me go, oh

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is just you and me always
Give me affection
I need your perfection
'Cause you feel so good
You make me stutter, stutter, stutter

You knock me down, I can't get up, I'm stuck
Gotta stop shaking me up
I can't eat, can't sleep, can't think
Sinking under, I'm sinking under

You're just a fantasy girl
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
I give you everything
Pay some attention to me
All I want is you and me always
You're just a fantasy girl (You're just a fantasy girl)
It's an impossible world
All I want is to be with you always
Give me affection, I need your perfection
'Cause it feels so good you make me stutter

I'll give you everything
Give some attention to me
All I want is you and me always

Give me affection
I need your perfection (Oh yeah)
'Cause it feels so good, you make me stutter (I really, I really)
You make me stutter (I really, I really)
You make me stutter

Ooh
Ooh

Living inside my head
Pulling my strings
Letting me think I'm in control

Giving you all of my heart
Was a good start
But it turns out you want my soul

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
So tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

Ooh
Ooh

Pushing me over the edge
Can't forget those things you said
Cut to the bone

Go ahead, take your swing
What did you think?
I was just gonna roll over? Oh no

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
I'm tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong
Gotta tell me what you really want
'Cause I don't wanna be
Oh, I don't wanna be alone

Ooh
Ooh
I don't wanna be

I've put myself on the line
I'm tired of wasting my time
There's got to be a reason why
She will not talk to me, no oh

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

I don't know nothing about that
In fact I don't know nothing at all
So tired of proving you right
By doing everything so wrong

Tell me what you really want
I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be alone

Ooh
Ooh

You push me
I don't have the strength to
Resist or control you
To take me down, take me down

You hurt me
But do I deserve this?
You make me so nervous
Calm me down, calm me down

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So come here
And never leave this place
Perfection of your face
Slows me down, slows me down

So fall down
I need you to trust me
Go easy, don't rush me
Help me out, why don't you help me out?

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So you say, "Go. It isn't working."
And I say, "No. It isn't perfect."
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
I'd give it all away just to get you back

And fake it, fake it all
Take what I can get

Knockin' so loud
Can you hear me yet?
Try to stay awake but you can't forget

Wake you up
In the middle of the night to say
I will never walk away again
I'm never gonna leave this bed, oh

So you say, "Go. It isn't working."
And I say, "No. It isn't perfect."
So I stay instead
I'm never gonna leave this bed, ooh

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have
Take it, take it all
Take all that I have

Ooh (Ah, la la la la la la la)
Ooh (Ah, la la la la la la la)

I must have been a fool
To love you so hard for so long
So much stronger than before
But so much harder to move on
And now the bitter chill of the winter
Still blows through me like a plague
Only to wake up with an empty bed
On a perfect summer day (Ooh)

My world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road (Ooh)

I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday

I never did my best to express how I really felt
And now that I know exactly what I want
You found somebody else (Ooh)

And my world just feels so cold
And you find yourself
Walking down the wrong side of the road (Oh yeah)

I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heartbeat like yesterday

(Ah, la la la la la la la) Yeah
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Yeah yeah
(Ah, la la la la la la la) Oh
(Ah, la la la la) Yeah, oh

My world just feels so cold
And I find myself
Thinking about the things I could have done
And it warms my soul
When you let me know
I'm not the only one

I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

I can't lie, you're on my mind
Stuck inside my head
I wanna feel your heart beat for me instead, yeah
I just die so much inside
Now that you're not there
I wanna feel your heart beat like yesterday

Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me
Put your hands, all over, put your hands all over me
(Put your hands all over me)

I can't seem to find the pretty little face I left behind
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a better place to call home
Gave her a place to stay, and she got up and ran away
Well, now I've had enough
Her pretty little face has torn me up

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say
Play me and put me away (Put your hands all over me)

Now you've lost your mind
The pretty little girl I left behind
And now you're getting rough
But everybody knows you're not that tough
Wandered out on the open road
Looking for a place to call your own
Scared to death of the road ahead
Pretty little thing, don't get upset

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me
Tell me everything is gonna be alright
Put your hands all over me
Please walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me (Ooh-ooh)
(Woo) Put your hands all over me (Yeah, yeah)
(Yeah) Put your hands all over me (Ooh-ooh)
All over me

So come down off your cloud
Say it now say it loud
Get up in my face
Pretty little girl, come make my day

Put your hands all over me
Please talk to me, talk to me (Oh)
Put your hands all over me
Now walk with me, walk with me now
Put your hands all over me
Gotta talk to me, talk to me
Come on now, babe
Put your hands all over me
Gotta walk with me, walk with me now
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Love is a game you say, play me and put me away
Put your hands all over me
Yeah (All over me)

Put your hands, all over
Put your hands all over me

Oh

I have been searching for your touch
Unlike any touch I've ever known
And I never thought about you much
'Til I'm broken down and all alone, oh

Though I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying, oh
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back

But how?
But how?

I can feel it in my guts
What's going on with him now?
And don't patronise me with lies
I'm a man, be a woman now, oh

I have been bound by the shackles of love
And I don't mind if I die tied up, oh
Took it for granted when you lifted me up

I'm asking for your help
I am going through hell
Afraid nothing can save me but the sound of your voice
You cut out all the noise
And now that I can see mistakes so clearly now
I'd kill if I could take you back

But how?
But how?
But how?
But how?

Oh, yeah
Why must we be so ugly?
And please do not think ill of me
Why does the one you love
Become the one who makes you want to cry
Why?
Why?
Why?

(And how?
How?)

But I don't understand the meaning of love
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying
I do not mind if I die trying

You are relentless
I am defenseless
Why did you knock me down tonight?
You beat me senseless
I just don't get this
How many times do I have to try?

Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone
Oh, yeah, yeah

You reprimanded
You're so demanding
But I've got time
I don't mind at all (Oh)
You're picture perfect
Completely worth it
You've got my back against the wall (Yeah, yeah)

Your whisper, so clear
The world disappears
As I fall into the darkness
It's impossible to express
How good it feels
I'm wrapped up, I'm sealed
So tired, I'll never be free
All night, don't fight the feeling

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
Please don't resist anymore
I'll never leave you alone

And can you hear me calling?
I'm screaming, scratching, crawling
You ignore me 'cause I'm always
Coming back to you, coming back to you
And you know how much I miss it
And you know I can't resist it
See your lips and just come running
Right on back to you, right on back to you

Get back in my life
Come knock on my door
What I'm looking for
I think you should know
You started a fire
Burned me to the floor
I can't do this anymore
I'll never leave you alone

(Get back in my life) Get back in my life (Ooh)
(What I'm looking for) Come on now (I think you should know)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Come knock on my door (Oh)
What I'm looking for
I'll never leave you alone
Get back in my life (Oh)
Come scream and scratch on my door
What I'm looking for
I can't do this anymore
Get back in my life (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Come scream and scratch on my door
What I'm looking for
Get back in my life (Get back in my life)
What I'm looking for

I watched you cry, bathed in sunlight by the bathroom door
You said you wished you did not love me anymore
You left your flowers in the backseat of my car
The things we said and did have left permanent scars

Obsessed, depressed at the same time
I can't even walk in a straight line
I've been lying in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have, oh yeah
(Just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling)
'Cause I can't believe that it's over

You've hit your low, you've lost control
And you wanna come back
You may not believe me, but I gave you all I had

Undress, confess that you're still mine
I roll around in a bed full of tears
And I'm still lying in the dark, no sunshine
No sunshine
No sunshine

She cries
This is more than goodbye
When I look into your eyes
You're not even there (Yeah)
It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling) Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh)
No, I can't believe that it's over now
(Just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
It's just a feeling, just a feeling that I have, oh

So much to say
It's not the way she does her hair
It's the way she seems to stare right through my eyes (Oh, oh)
And in the darkest day when she refused to run away
From love she tried so hard to save

It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh)
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
(It's just a feeling) It's just a feeling
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have
Just a feeling
Just a feeling that I have (Oh, oh yeah)

I can't believe that it's over
(It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
(Just a feeling) I can't believe that it's over
(It's just a feeling, just a feeling, just a feeling that I have)
Now I can't believe that's it's over, yeah

What am I supposed to do with this time?
If there's so many holes, I stay afloat
But I feel out of control
So petrified, I'm petrified, mm
What am I supposed to do to get by?
Did I lose everything I need to survive?
'Cause at 4 AM, when the sweat sets in
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or did you just get on with your life?
Oh

Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

What am I supposed to do with these clothes? (Oh)
It's my twisted way of keeping you close (Yeah, yeah)
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a broken man
Did you get my message? Did it send?
Or do you get along on your own?

Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

And it breaks me down when I see your face
You look so different but you feel the same
And I do not understand
I cannot comprehend
The chills your body sends
Why did it have to end?

I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away
Oh, I'm taking time to think and I
Don't think it's fair for us to
Turn around and say goodbye
I have this feeling when I
Finally find the words to say
But I can't tell you if you turn around
And run away, run away

Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Turn around and
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
But I can't tell you if you
Runaway, runaway (Runaway)
Turn around and runaway (Runaway)

I'm sure that he could give you everything
Stability and diamond rings
All the things I do not have
I understand you can't handle that
But for everything that I lack
I provide something you almost had
Hot flesh that you yearn to grab
Pit of your stomach, you're still so sad

Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Out of sight, not out of mind
You want the world, I'll give you mine
'Cause you're the girl I'll never find
And I'm the boy you've left behind, whoa
I know you think you're satisfied
And God knows how hard we try
But if you showed up at my door (Ooh)
I could give you so much more, oh

Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Don't you wanna dance?
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
This may be the last chance (Last chance)
That you get (You get) to love me (Love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Oh, you sure don't make it easy to get myself to safety
You tell me that I'm crazy
But you're the one who makes me this way
You call yourself impulsive
But that's what makes us so explosive

So as I burn these photographs
I wonder if you kept the ones you have
Keep them locked up somewhere safe
'Cause it's the only place you'll see my face

Ooh, what you gonna do?
I'm in love with you
Why don't you wanna dance?
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (To love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, what am I gonna do?
I don't like to lose
You're not making sense
'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That you get (You get) to love me (Love me)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

'Cause this may be the last chance (Last chance)
That I get (I get) to love you (Love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh
To love you (Love you)
Ooh-ooh-ooh

You say you need someone
But everybody does
I'm no different than you
I just believe what I do
You point your finger at
Everyone but yourself
And blame the ones that you love
Who're only trying to help

As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me in you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever

Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

I have no time for fear
Or people in my ear
Head down and running so fast
Try not to dwell on the past
I'm fighting through this pain
And things I cannot change
Running right into the flames
Rather than running away

As it's winding down to zero
I am your unlikely hero
I'll see this through
There's so much me in you
Take this enemy together
Fight these demons off forever
Forever, forever, forever

Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

Sweat drips down from every angle
Love your body as it gathers in a pool by your feet
You turn up the heat
Tossing and turning, you cannot sleep
Quietly weep, you're in too deep

Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

Five, four, three, two, one
I won't stop until it's done
No curtain call, I will not fall
This may be the one we've been waiting for
No curtain call, just take it all

Yeah, yeah
Oh

Some people live for the fortune
Some people live just for the fame
Some people live for the power, yeah
Some people live just to play the game

Some people think that the physical things
Define what's within
Oh, I've been there before
But that life's a bore
So full of the superficial

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, yeah

Some people search for a fountain
Promises forever young, wait
Some people need three dozen roses
Uh, and that's the only way to prove you love them, oh

Hand me the world on a silver platter
And what good would it be? Oh
With no one to share
With no one who truly cares for me

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you, you, you

Some people want it all
But I don't want nothing at all
If it ain't you, baby
If I ain't got you, baby
Some people want diamond rings
Some just want everything
But everything means nothing
If I ain't got you

If I ain't got you with me, baby
'Cause there ain't nothing in this whole wide world
Doesn't mean a thing
If I ain't got you with me, baby, yeah
Yeah! We love you, Alicia Keys

People never change
They seem to stay the same
They wear different clothes
But play the same games

Many different ways
To say the same thing
Searching for the right words
The ones that would make you stay

Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing these words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

Oh I'm not even really sure
Who made this mess
And who threw what punch
But I could not care less
All I know is that I'm here
And you are not, oh
Once I put this wasted pride aside
Nothing's all I got, oh

Exchanging the way things were
For the way that they should be
Yeah
And choosing these words
Is saying to her
The things that she never heard
But always deserved

I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry

Oh
Somebody make it stop
Yeah
And pick me up
And just dust me off, ohs
The rainy day flood
Will drown all this love
Trapped at the bottom now
Please dig me up

I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry (Yeah)

I figured out what it is all about
It's you that I could never live without
You're everything
The air that I breathe
Stupid not to know it all along
And everything I ever did was wrong
Sadly it's too late for sorry (Yeah, ooh)

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

You and I go hard at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the doors
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we stopped keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah, I know that we can't do this no more

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I've said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you "No", but my body keeps on telling you "yes"
Try to tell you "Stop", but your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
And I'll be waking up, feeling satisfied, but guilty as hell

Yeah but baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you (Making me love you)
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go (Let it all go)
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo (Like a tattoo, yeah)
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid crawling back to you

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah)

(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night (Whoa, yeah)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Yeah, baby, give me one more night
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Oh yeah yeah

But baby, there you go again, there you go again
Making me love you
Yeah, I stopped using my head, using my head
Let it all go
Got you stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

So I cross my heart, and I hope to die (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
And I know I've said it a million times
(Oh, I've said it a million times)
But I'll only stay with you one more night
(Yeah, baby, give me one more night)
So I cross my heart and I hope to die (Yeah, yeah)
That I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah, yeah)
And I know I've said it a million times (Yeah, yeah)
But I'll only stay with you one more night (Yeah, yeah)

I dunno
Whatever, whatever

Here I am waiting
I'll have to leave soon
Why am I holding on?
We knew this day would come
We knew it all along
How did it come so fast?

This is our last night, but it's late
And I'm trying not to sleep
'Cause I know when I wake
I will have to slip away

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

Here I am staring
At your perfection
In my arms, so beautiful
The sky is getting bright
The stars are burning out
Somebody slow it down

This is way too hard
'Cause I know when the sun comes up
I will leave, this is my last glance
That will soon be a memory

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

I never want it to stop
Because I don't wanna start all over, start all over
I was afraid of the dark
But now it's all that I want, all that I want, all that I want

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

And when the daylight comes I'll have to go
But tonight, I'm gonna hold you so close
'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own
But tonight, I need to hold you so close

Ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa
Ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa, ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

Ooh-whoa-oa (Yeah), ooh-whoa-oa (Yeah)
Ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa (Yeah, yeah)
Ooh-whoa-oa (Yeah), ooh-whoa-oa (Yeah-eah)
Ooh-whoa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa-oa

You're such a motivator, I gotta get you here
So sick of saying yes sir, yes sir
You're such an instigator, you wanna play the game
Take it or leave it, that's her, that's her

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

Stuck in her elevator, she take me to the sky
And I don't wanna go down, go down
She said I'll feel you later, go ahead and fantasize
She'll make me want her right now right now

And I can't wait another minute
I can't take the look she's giving
Your body rocking, keep me up all night
One in a million, my lucky strike

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake
Hey, you're taking all my pain away
You're shaking like an earthquake

Got me so high and then she dropped me
But she got me, she got me, she got me bad
Took me inside and then she rocked me
She keep me up all night, this is what it sounds like
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) My lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million, my lucky strike

My lucky strike, my lucky strike
(Oh) Your body rocking, keep me up all night
(Oh) One in a million

Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming at each other
Like, "Oh, oh, oh," can't take it anymore
Like a tragedy, like a dark comedy
Laughing at each other, laughing at each other
Like, "Oh, oh, oh," it isn't funny anymore

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh, yeah

Sometimes honesty is the worst policy
Happy ever after, happy ever after
Let it go, you never need to know
I don't wanna be picking up all of these
Tiny little pieces, tiny little pieces
Of your heart, won't do it anymore

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh

I was the
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh

In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
What am I doing in Hollywood Boulevard?
In the middle of Hollywood Boulevard
Screaming at each other, screaming

I was the man who never lied
Never lied until today
But I just couldn't break your heart
Like you did mine yesterday (I was the man)
I was the man who never lied (Oh, I was the man)
Never lied until today (Oh-oh)
But I just couldn't break your heart (Oh-oh)
Like you did mine yesterday (Oh, yeah)
I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh (Oh, I was the man)
(I was the man) I was the man who never lied, oh-oh-oh (I was the man)

Whoa, yeah

I know your insides are feeling so hollow (Ooh)
And it's a hard pill for you to swallow, yeah (Ooh)
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half-way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half-way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

You're such a hard act for me to follow (Ooh)
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow, yeah (Ooh)
But if I fall for you, I'll never recover
If I fall for you, I'll never be the same

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half-way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day
I know we're only half-way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

I don't know where to start, I'm just a little lost
I wanna feel like we're never gonna ever stop
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you
Asking you to stay, you should stay, stay with me tonight, yeah

I really wanna love somebody
I really wanna dance the night away
I know we're only half-way there
But you take me all the way, you take me all the way
I really wanna touch somebody
I think about you every single day

But you take me all the way, you take me all the way

Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

You take me all the way, you take me all the way, yeah

Baby, it's not alright
The second that you turn your back, she'll be outta sight
Baby, she'll break your heart
The second that you spend the night apart, -art

How could you do it?
Oh, how could you walk away
From everything we made?
How could you do it?
Oh, you better watch yourself
I think that girl's insane

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a lady killer

Baby, she'll eat you alive
As soon as she smells your blood in the water
You better run to survive
Before she makes you her latest slaughter

How could you do it?
Oh, just come back to me
Baby, I'm begging, please
How could you do it?
Oh, she knows I love you still
You're just her latest kill

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a lady killer

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a lady killer

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
She's in it just to win it
Don't trust her for a minute
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
It's like a cheap thriller
She's such a lady killer

I'm not a fortune teller, I won't be bringing news
Of what tomorrow brings, I'll leave that up to you
I'm not a fortune teller, don't have a crystal ball
I can't predict the future, can't see nothing at all
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll by, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

I don't like watching TV, I don't know what it all means
And your American Dream, baby, it just isn't me
I know what I'm thinking may not be on your mind
I know the song I'm singing is not your favorite kind
It doesn't mean I'm afraid of all the things that you say
But I just think we should stay stuck in the moment today
And as the seasons roll back, no matter how hard I try
Summer will end and the leaves will turn again

I don't know why you're acting like this
I don't know why you had to do it again
Why'd you have to go and ruin the night?
Don't worry about tomorrow's mess

I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

This feeling keeps growing
These rivers keep flowing
How can I have answers
When you drown me in questions?

I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never know how the future will go
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller
I'll never change, but I want you to stay
I don't know what to tell you, I'm not a fortune teller

Man, it's been a long day
Stuck thinking 'bout it driving on the freeway
Wondering if I really tried everything I could
Not knowing if I should try a little harder

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

I'm kicking the curb
'Cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt
'Cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have

I'm so sad, sad

Man, it's been a long night
Just sitting here, trying not to look back
Still looking at the road we never drove on
And wondering if the one I chose was the right one

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

I'm kicking the curb
'Cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt
'Cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have

I'm so sad, sad
I'm so sad, so sad

Oh, but I'm scared to death
That there may not be another one like this
And I confess
That I'm only holding on by a thin, thin thread

I'm kicking the curb
'Cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad
And I'm kicking the dirt
'Cause I never gave you
The things that you needed to have

And I'm kicking the curb
'Cause you never heard
The words that you needed so bad

I'm so sad, so sad

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

It's funny how you say that you made it on your own
When you haven't worked for anyone your daddy didn't know
You say you got a job, but I don't know what you do
Such a fu—, fu— fucking snob that you'll never know the truth

You're perfect on the outside, but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body make—, make—, makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body make—, make—, makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go
And I'm stuck sitting in the front row
I'm singing along like there's no tomorrow

La la la la la la la la

I know you wanna stay, but I think that you should go
'Cause you got nothing to say, you just sit there on your phone
I try not to give in, but temptation has me lost
So I will do my best to get you off

You're perfect on the outside but nothing at the core
It's easy to forget when you show up at my door
Stop messing with my mind, 'cause you'll never have my heart
But your perfect little body make—, make—, makes me fall apart
Your perfect little body make—, make—, makes me fall apart

She's got tickets to her own show
But nobody wants to go

Oh!
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

Hey you, don't wanna love you on the telephone
You're hanging up and I am all alone
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now, I wanna find you, but you're on the run
My heart's exploding like a burning sun
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

Hey you, say that you're only havin' fun, and then
You call me up at 3 AM again
Baby, you got me doin' dirt, doin' dirt, doin' dirt
And now (Now) all that I got is just a microphone
To let you know that I am all alone
I know you like it when it hurts, when it hurts, when it hurts (Oh)

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

Yeah, come on

So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home
So right now, I wanna leave with you right now
I wanna be with you all night, get in the car and let's go
Yeah, let's take it home, let's take it home, let's take it home (Oh)

Hold me, we're dancing in the dark of the night
You're shining like a neon light
I light you up when I get inside
So won't you touch me?
'Cause everybody's watching us now
We're putting on a show for the crowd
So turn it up, baby, make it loud

I count the ways I let you down
On my fingers and toes, but I'm running out
Clever words can't help me now
I grip you tight, but you're slipping out

And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah

When did the rain become a storm?
When did the clouds begin to form?
Yeah, we got knocked off course by a natural force
And we'll, we'll be swimming when it's gone

And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, so in love that night
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah

All the pain you try to hide
Shows through your mascara lines
As they stream down from your eyes
And let them go, let them fly
Holding back won't turn back time
Believe me, I've tried

And your eyes were so bright
I remember your eyes were so bright
And I remember your eyes were so bright
When I first met you, how in love were we that night?
And now I'm kissing your tears goodnight
And I can't take it, you're even perfect when you cry

Beautiful goodbye (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Oh, yeah
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Your beautiful goodbye, whoa (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
It's dripping from your eyes (Bye-bye, bye-bye)
Yeah, yeah

Ooh, ooh
Oh, oh, yeah
Hee, oh

I'm afraid that I gotta do what I gotta do
But if I let you go, where you gonna go?
We gotta make a change, time to turn the page
Something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you
We've been through tougher times, you know it gets worse
We can turn this around, please let me be first
And as I feel your tears spilling on my shirt
Something isn't right and I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry (Cry)

I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Oh, oh, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

When did we cross the line? How could we could forget?
Why did we let the pressure get into our heads?
Your broken heart requires all of my attention
'Cause something isn't right, I don't wanna fight you

Hey you, come over and let me embrace you
I know that I'm causing you pain too
But remember if you need to cry (Cry)

I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Please don't lose your faith
Don't worry 'cause I'm here to keep you safe
I promise if you let me see your face
That I won't let you down, I won't let you down

I'm here to wipe your eyes
Tonight, before you fall asleep
I run my thumb across your cheek (Across your cheek)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes
I know I made you feel this way
You gotta breathe, we'll be okay (Be okay)
Cry, 'cause I'm here to wipe your eyes

Slow is the memory
And I can picture her standing right in front of me
Said that I'm behaving badly
And kind of driving her crazy
But I know she wants me
I remember everything
Her sweat, it tastes like sugar cane
And sitting on top of me, yelling out my fucking name
Until I'm empty
But I know she wants me

But I have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry, yeah
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Whoa, oh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'll see you when I get back
Maybe we can get ourselves back on the right track
You touch me there because you know how much I like that
I think that we both need to relax, you know you want me
All the time and everywhere
A happy surface, but the underbelly isn't there
And the worst thing is that I don't even really care
And the emptiness is too much to bear

But I, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

'Cause sometimes I don't know what to do
I'm scared to stand right in front of you
The way our pain subsides
Can't bear the stare of your teary eyes
I know you feel like it's hard to stay
In fact, you may just wanna run away
Now all that I can really say is, baby, oh
Deep down you know, yeah

I, have already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
Drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry
Already tried to explain myself
It's not that I love someone else
But I can't bear to listen to you cry
Sick of all these wasted years
I'm drowned in someone else's tears
You let me down, now I'm hanging you out to dry

Oh, no, no, no, oh, no, no, no
Yeah, ooh, dry
Ooh, yeah

I miss the taste of a sweeter life
I miss the conversation
I'm searching for a song tonight
I'm changing all of the stations

I like to think that we had it all
We drew a map to a better place
But on that road I took a fall
Oh, baby, why did you run away?

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder, where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following

I hear your voice in my sleep at night
Hard to resist temptation
'Cause something strange has come over me
And now I can't get over you
No, I just can't get over you, ooh

I was there for you
In your darkest times
I was there for you
In your darkest nights

But I wonder where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you
Following, following, following to you
The map that leads to you
Ain't nothing I can do
The map that leads to you

Oh oh oh

Oh, in your darkest times
Oh, I was there for you
Oh, in your darkest nights

Oh, in your darkest nights

But I wonder, where were you
When I was at my worst
Down on my knees
And you said you had my back?
So I wonder, where were you
When all the roads you took came back to me?

So I'm following the map that leads to you

Woke up sweating from a dream
With a different kind of feeling (mm)
All day long my heart was beating
Searching for the meaning (mm)

Hazel eyes
I was so color-blind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

It was always you
Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied

It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you

All my hidden desires
Finally came alive, mm
No, I never told a lie
To you. So, why would I start tonight?

Hazel eyes
I was so color-blind
We were just wasting time, oh oh
For my whole life
We never crossed the line
Only friends in my mind
But now I realize

Can't believe I could not see it all this time, all this time
It was always you
Now I know why my heart wasn't satisfied, satisfied

It was always you, you
No more guessing who
Looking back now I know it was always you, always you

It was always you

If you respect me, don't protect me
You can tell me; I can handle it
Stop pretending, 'cause we're going down
If you let go, then just let go
It's disrespectful how you've handled this
Never ending, kinda run around

I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

Un-kiss me, un-touch me
Un-take this heart
And I'm missing just one thing
A brand new start

Can't erase this, can't delete this
I don't need this, I can't handle it
I just feel it that you're over us
Oh, if I wait here, if I see you
It won't matter, what's the point of this?
We're in pieces, because you're over us, ooh

I lied to my heart, 'cause I thought you felt it
You can't light a fire if the candle's melted
No, you don't have to love me if you don't wanna
Don't act like I mean nothing, but if you're gonna
Well, then you better

You got in so late, it's Sunday morning
Said that you were leaving, letting go of us
Where did we go wrong?
And now you say you're leaving California
Gotta head back east and wanna leave tonight
Pack your things and go, go!

But if you run away, I won't be alright

Even if the sun crashes into us

Yeah, why you talk that evil? Yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no
Say, what you're crying at me for, me for?
Try to control your ego, yeah
That's not the way you show love, show love
No love, no love, no no

'Cause I got all the things I wanna say but nothing's coming out
And all the times I came to you, I never, ever lied
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl
Show me that phone in your pocket
So wait, you think that I don't know what this is really all about?
It should be really easy if you had nothing to hide
Show me that phone in your pocket, girl

Falling in love with you every night, yeah

This is a new love, this is a new love, this is a new love

You're the only drug I wanna do, yeah

Looking at the same sky that we used to lay under
Are you thinking about the love that I took from us?

When you close your eyes, do you see me, love?
Am I keeping you awake?
What you scared about? Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know

You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, don't you worry, girl
You know that I'm coming back for you
Don't you worry, girl, I'll be back for you
So you better wait up, keeping the bed warm for me
All night putting your whisper on me
Giving that love and emotion that I know
Doesn't really matter what you do
I'll be back for you, coming back for you, yeah

I know there are millions of miles in between our hearts
But I will come running for you, I don't care how far

When you close your eyes, do you see me, love?
Am I keeping you awake?
What you scared about? Are you giving up?
When you know, you know, you know

Woo, woo!
Oh, yeah

You and me and all that wine
Loosen my tie, lie down, let's fly
Every guy that passes by (Look at her, look at her, ooh)
And you say that it's not right
But where does he think you are tonight?
Does he know your nasty side? (Look at her, look at her, ooh)

If you want me, take me home and let me use you
I know he doesn't satisfy you like I do
And does he know that there's nobody quite like you?
So let me tell you all the things he never told you, yeah

I've got these feelings for you
And I can't help myself no more
Can't fight these feelings for you
No, I can't help myself no more
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah

You and me, let's go all night
Going so high, we fuck the sky
Come with me now, fuck that guy (Look at her, look at her, ooh)
Now you flash that sexy smile
And tell me I've got to wait a while
And it makes me lose my mind (Look at her, look at her, ooh)

I know he doesn't satisfy you like I do
And does he know that there's nobody quite like you?
So let me tell you all the things he never told you, yeah

Yeah, you gotta let it go
'Cause we're losing grip now
It's about to go down
Would you let me talk to you?
You gotta let me know
'Cause I'm on the edge now
Of a nervous breakdown
'Cause I can't get through to you, you

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot

You never let me go
Got me chained to your touch
Like a slave for your love
I'm ashamed to say it's true, oh
Afraid to let you go
'Cause without you I'm lost
And no matter the cost
I'll be standing next to you, oh

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot
When you get that feeling
When you get that feeling
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot love
Don't shoot love, baby
Don't shoot

My back's against the wall tonight
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights off
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights off
I see the fear that's in your eyes
So go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot the lights off
Go ahead pull the trigger
Shoot

I got my hands up screaming
Got my hands up screaming
Don't shoot love, baby

Please don't see
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me
Reaching out for someone I can't see

Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy?
Woe is me
If we're not careful turns into reality

But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears

And God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and the lambs are on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
Just the same

And God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's hunting season and this lamb is on the run
Searching for meaning
But are we all lost stars trying to light ... light up the dark?

And I thought I saw you out there crying
And I thought I heard you call my name
And I thought I heard you out there crying
But are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?
Are we all lost stars trying to light up the dark?

You tell me I don't care
Tell me I never try
I said I'm sorry
Maybe a million times (I just want)
It's gonna hurt you
If I don't say goodbye
You don't believe me
You don't believe me

I just want the best for you (oooh)

But I'm just not the best for you (for you)

You're standing there with your cigarette
Looking at me like we've never met
I know I fucked up, so I'll take the blame
And I don't expect you, to let me explain
You can't forgive, I can't forget
I know you're just too different now

But I miss you and that denim jacket
I let you get away, I let you get away
Do you still wear that denim jacket?

I keep seeing visions of you
Visions of, visions of you

Stuck in this déjà-vu

It's like I'm never riding solo
I feel you walking in my shadow
Never hit me quite like that though

Late nights and I can't sleep
Choked up and I can't breathe
No one that can save me

Yeah, yeah, darling (To me, yeah, yeah)
Ah-ha, don't do this to me

You could make a grown man cry
If you ever said "Goodbye"
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)
You could make a grown man cry
If you ever left my side
Never let you go, oh, I (Never let you go, oh, I)

You're the only hand in my back pocket
If you ever left, I'd go psychotic
Heaven, hear me cryin', cryin' (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Baby, you're the key to my heart, lock it
If you ever left, never unlock it
Lonely like an island, island (Ooh, ooh, ooh)

If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
I'm never gonna need nobody's love but yours (But yours)
If my love ain't your love
It's never gonna be nobody's love
Never gonna need nobody's touch but yours (But yours)

Nobody, nobody's love

Here's to the ones that we got
Cheers to the wish you were here, but you're not
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
Of everything we've been through
Toast to the ones here today
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
And the memories bring back, memories bring back you

There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
Now my heart feel like December when somebody say your name
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, yeah

Everybody hurts sometimes
Everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
But everything gon' be alright
Go and raise a glass and say, ayy
